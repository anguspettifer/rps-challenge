As a marketeer
So that I can enjoy myself away from the daily grind
I would like to be able to play rock/paper/scissors

Well “play” rock paper scissors is broad. How can we break this down?

1. I would like to initiate a game of rock paper scissors
2. I would like to choose my weapon
3. I would like to find out the result
4. I would like to play again
5. I would like to see the tally of scores
6. I would like some entertaining imagery
